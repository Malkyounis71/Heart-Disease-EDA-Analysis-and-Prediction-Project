About this dataset


Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

ca: number of major vessels (0-3)

cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type

Value 1: typical angina
Value 2: atypical angina
Value 3: non-anginal pain
Value 4: asymptomatic
trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results

Value 0: normal
Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
thalach : maximum heart rate achieved

target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

age: Age of the patient in years

sex: Gender of the patient (0: female, 1: male)

cp: Type of chest pain (0: Typical angina, 1: Atypical angina, 2: Non-anginal pain, 3: Asymptomatic)

trtbps: Resting blood pressure in mmHg

chol: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl

fbs: Fasting blood sugar level categorized as above 120 mg/dl (0: false, 1: true)

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0: Normal, 1: ST-T wave abnormality, 2: Showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy)

thalachh: Maximum heart rate achieved during a stress test exng: Exercise induced angina (0: no, 1: yes)

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (unit -> depression)

slp: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0: Upsloping, 1: Flat, 2: Downsloping)

caa: Number of major vessels (0-4) colored by fluoroscopy thall: Thalium stress test result (0: Normal, 1: Fixed defect, 2: Reversible defect, 3: Not described)

output: Heart disease status (0: no disease, 1: presence of disease
